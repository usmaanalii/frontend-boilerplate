# Frontend boilerplate

Creating a boilerplate for future frontend projects, gulp will be used to create build the projects.

The boilerplate will use the following...

    - HTML partials
    - SASS (7-1 Architecture)
    - Javascript

Gulp will be used to concatenate, minify and purify the files which will then be located in the `dist` directory.

In order to use this boilerplate, `clone` the repository and run `npm install`.
